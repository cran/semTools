\details{
The coefficient alpha (Cronbach, 1951) can be calculated by 

\deqn{ \alpha = \frac{k}{k - 1}\left[ 1 - \frac{\sum^{k}_{i = 1} \sigma_{ii}}{\sum^{k}_{i = 1} \sigma_{ii} + 2\sum_{i < j} \sigma_{ij}} \right],}

where \eqn{k} is the number of items in a factor, \eqn{\sigma_{ii}} is the item \emph{i} observed variances, \eqn{\sigma_{ij}} is the observed covariance of items \emph{i} and \emph{j}.

The coefficient omega (Raykov, 2001) can be calculated by 

\deqn{ \omega =\frac{\left( \sum^{k}_{i = 1} \lambda_i \right)^{2} Var\left( \psi \right)}{\left( \sum^{k}_{i = 1} \lambda_i \right)^{2} Var\left( \psi \right) + \sum^{k}_{i = 1} \theta_{ii} + 2\sum_{i < j} \theta_{ij} }, }

where \eqn{\lambda_i} is the factor loading of item \emph{i}, \eqn{\psi} is the factor variance, \eqn{\theta_{ii}} is the variance of measurement errors of item \emph{i}, and \eqn{\theta_{ij}} is the covariance of measurement errors from item \emph{i} and \emph{j}. 

The second coefficient omega (Bentler, 1972, 2009) can be calculated by 

\deqn{ \omega_2 = 1 - \frac{\bold{1}\prime \Theta \bold{1}}{\bold{1}^\prime \hat{\Sigma} \bold{1}}, }

where \eqn{\Theta} is the measurement error covariance matrix, \eqn{\hat{\Sigma}} is the model-implied covariance matrix, and \eqn{\bold{1}} is the \eqn{k}-dimensional vector of 1. The first and the second coefficients omega will have different values if there are dual loadings (or the existence of method factors). The first coefficient omega can be viewed as the reliability controlling for the other factors. The second coefficient omega can be viewed as the unconditional reliability. 

The third coefficient omega (McDonald, 1999) can be calculated by

\deqn{ \omega_3 = 1 - \frac{\bold{1}\prime \Theta \bold{1}}{\bold{1}^\prime \Sigma \bold{1}}, }

where \eqn{\Sigma} is the observed covariance matrix. If the model fits the data well, the third coefficient omega will be similar to the other two. Note that if there is a directional effect in the model, all coefficients omega will use the total factor variances, which is calculated by the \code{\link{impliedFactorCov}} function.

If measurement errors are not correlated, the last term in the denominator of the middle expression is dropped. For the categorical items, the reliability indices are calculated from the latent variable underlying the categorical items (i.e., using polychoric/polyserial correlations). Therefore, the coefficient alpha from this function may be not the same as the standard alpha calculation for categorical items. Researchers may check the \code{alpha} function in the \code{psych} package for the standard coefficient alpha calculation.
