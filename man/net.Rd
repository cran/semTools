\title{Nesting and Equivalence Testing}
\usage{
net(..., crit = 1e-04)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{The \code{lavaan} objects used for test of nesting and
equivalence}

\item{crit}{The upper-bound criterion for testing the equivalence of models.
Models are considered nested (or equivalent) if the difference between
their \eqn{\chi^2} fit statistics is less than this criterion.}
}
\value{
The \linkS4class{Net} object representing the outputs for nesting
  and equivalent testing, including a logical matrix of test results and a
  vector of degrees of freedom for each model.
}
\description{
This test examines whether models are nested or equivalent based on Bentler
and Satorra's (2010) procedure.
}
\details{
The concept of nesting/equivalence should be the same regardless of
estimation method. However, the particular method of testing
nesting/equivalence (as described in Bentler & Satorra, 2010) employed by
the net function analyzes summary statistics (model-implied means and
covariance matrices, not raw data). In the case of robust methods like MLR,
the raw data is only utilized for the robust adjustment to SE and chi-sq,
and the net function only checks the unadjusted chi-sq for the purposes of
testing nesting/equivalence.  This method does not apply to models that
estimate thresholds for categorical data, so an error message will be issued
if such a model is provided.
